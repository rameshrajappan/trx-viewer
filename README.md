# Instructions to Build and Distribute
## Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Run the application:
```
npm start
```

## Build the application:
```
npm run dist
```
This command will create an installable or shareable file in the dist folder of your project directory. 
You can distribute the generated executable file to others, and they can install and run your TRX file viewer like a regular application.
